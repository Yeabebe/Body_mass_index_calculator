# BMI Calculator (HTML + JavaScript)

This is a simple web-based **BMI (Body Mass Index)** calculator created using HTML and JavaScript. It prompts the user to input their weight and height, then calculates and displays the BMI value in the browser console.

## 📌 What It Does

- Prompts the user to enter their **weight (kg)** and **height (m)**
- Calculates the BMI using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2}
  \]
- Outputs the result in the browser’s developer console

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. Enter your weight and height when prompted
4. Check the result in your browser's **Developer Console** (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🔍 Note

- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
- For better UX, you can improve this by showing results in the DOM instead of the console.

## ✅ To-Do (Optional Improvements)

- Display BMI result on the webpage
- Categorize the BMI (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight)
- Add input fields instead of `prompt()`
- Make it mobile responsive and styled with CSS
